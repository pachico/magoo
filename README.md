Magoo will mask sensitive data in strings. Built-in masks use regex to find credit card numbers and emails and will mask only those, leaving the rest of the string intact.  This might be useful, for instance, to log sensitive user input.
You can also mask strings that match your own regex or inject masking class as long as they implement a simple interface.


(If you have suggestions about more masks to implement, **please let me know**!)
